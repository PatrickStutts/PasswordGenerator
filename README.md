# PasswordGenerator
Hello!
Welcome to my password generator provided by computron.

As you can see my user promt does come up when the browser is loaded and before the generate button is clicked. There is a lot of code commented out that I thought would make that work, alas it gives me an error on line 41 when pulling hasUpper. I worked with a TA to try and solve this problem but to no avail. 

All the current code still prompts the user to pick a password length, allows the user to select characters of their choice and does indeed present a generated password after clicking the generate button. 

Thanks for reading!
